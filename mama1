hello 
is it me you looking for
I wonder where you are
I wonder what you do
are you somewhere feeling lonely
or is someone loving you?
tell me how I won your heart
since I havent got a clue
but let me start by saying 
I love you



Lady
you have made me what i am 
and I love you
In my eyes I see no one else but you

Whispers in the dark
